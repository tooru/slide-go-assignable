A value x is assignable to a variable of type T ("x is assignable to T") // HL
if one of the following conditions applies: // HL

- x's type is identical to T.
- x's type V and T have identical underlying types and at least one of V or T is not 
  a defined type.
- T is an interface type and x implements T. // HL
- x is a bidirectional channel value, T is a channel type, x's type V and T have identical
  element types, and at least one of V or T is not a defined type.
- x is the predeclared identifier nil and T is a pointer, function, slice, map, channel,
  or interface type.
- x is an untyped constant representable by a value of type T.
