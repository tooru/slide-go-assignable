The concrete value stored in an interface is not addressable, in the same way that // HL
a map element is not addressable.  // HL
Therefore, when you call a method on an interface, it must either have an identical
receiver type or it must be directly discernible from the concrete type:
pointer- and value-receiver methods can be called with pointers and values respectively,
as you would expect.
