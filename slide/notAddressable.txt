- The concrete value stored in an interface is not addressable, in the same way that // HL
  a map element is not addressable.  // HL
- Therefore, when you call a method on an interface, it must either have an identical receiver
  type or it must be directly discernible from the concrete type: pointer- and value-receiver
  methods can be called with pointers and values respectively, as you would expect.
- Value-receiver methods can be called with pointer values because they can be dereferenced first.
- Pointer-receiver methods cannot be called with values, however, because the value stored inside // HL
  an interface has no address. // HL
